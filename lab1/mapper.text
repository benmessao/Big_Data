Political 1
Correctness 1

you 1

Last 1

Forgive 1

Something 1

heads 1

ANNIE 1
Lionel 1
please. 1
You’re 1
only 1
technically 1
Black. 1
G, 1
going 1

You 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
hold 1
your 1

Thanks. 1
GEORGE 1
Annie 1
smiles 1

walks 1
out. 1
LIONEL 1
You 1
need 1
something? 1
Saw 1
your 1
email. 1
GEORGE 1
Yeah, 1
I 1
need 1
someone 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
Donor’s 1
function 1
on 1
Saturday. 1
Small 1
dinner 1
for 1
the 1
school’s 1
big 1
givers. 1
Administration 1
wants 1
a 1
little 1
coverage. 1
LIONEL 1
That’s 1
Halloween 1
night. 1
GEORGE 1
Right, 1
which 1
is 1
why 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
will 1
take 1
it. 1
LIONEL 1
Ah. 1
Thus 1
the 1
new 1
guy. 1
George 1
gathers 1
his 1
backpack 1
and 1
walks 1
over 1
to 1
Lionel. 1
Gets 1
close. 1
GEORGE 1
On 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
class, 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
stay 1
and 1
check 1
out 1
last 1
year’s 1
piece. 1
You’ll 1
do 1
fine. 1
LIONEL 1
I 1
don’t 1
know. 1
Are 1
there 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
racially 1
fueled 1
outbursts 1
at 1
this 1
thing? 1
GEORGE 1
Never 1
know 1
right? 1
79. 1
It’s 1
clear 1
Lionel 1
wants 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
else. 1
George 1
too. 1
LIONEL 1
Am 1
I 1
a 1
good 1
writer? 1
GEORGE 1
You’ll 1
get 1
better. 1
And 1
we 1
need 1
you 1
right 1
now. 1
LIONEL 1
You’re 1
just 1
a 1
big 1
recommendation 1
away 1
from 1
landing 1
the 1
Times. 1
GEORGE 1
God 1
I 1
hope 1
so. 1
Lionel 1
looks 1
down. 1
He 1
is 1
being 1
used. 1
Turns 1

go, 1
just 1
as 1
-Hey. 1
GEORGE 1
(CONT’D) 1
-- 1
George 1
grabs 1
Lionel 1
unsure 1
what 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
say. 1
So 1
instead 1
he 1
just 1
kisses 1
him. 1
GEORGE 1
(CONT’D) 1
I’m 1
glad 1
we 1
finally 1
got 1
that 1
Bugle 1
on 1
your 1

There’s 1
a 1

Call 1
me 1
after, 1

Hi. 1

you 1

Lionel’s 1

be 1

Hello 1

at 1

GABE 1

Read 1

off 1

We’ll 1

GABE 1
Sam 1
going 1

Shocked. 1
How’s 1
papa 1
White? 1
SAM 1
He’s 1
recovering. 1
GABE 1
Good. 1
Well... 1
Gabe 1
fights 1
the 1
urge 1
to 1
hug 1
her. 1
SAM 1
We 1
were 1
actually 1
on 1
the 1
phone 1
last 1
night 1
for 1
hours. 1
First 1
time 1
we 1
talked 1
since 1
the 1
bypass. 1
He 1
was 1
putting 1
up 1
a 1
strong 1
front. 1
Teasing 1
me 1
about 1
being 1
so 1
worried. 1
Then 1
came 1
the 1
stories 1
about 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
I’d 1
heard 1
a 1
thousand 1
times. 1
About 1
how 1
independent 1
I 1
was. 1
Gabe 1
smiles 1
politely. 1
Senses 1
she 1
needs 1
a 1
moment. 1
GABE 1
Want 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
it? 1
SAM 1
My 1
mother 1
worked 1
nights 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
to 1
school. 1
And 1
it 1
pissed 1
me 1
off 1
because 1
he 1
would 1
follow 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
homeroom. 1
Every 1
time 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
hold 1
my 1
hand 1
I’d 1
scream 1
and 1
pull 1
away. 1
He 1
thought 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
being...difficult. 1
A 1
hint 1
of 1
recognition 1
in 1
Gabe. 1
Is 1
this 1
about 1
them? 1
SAM 1
(CONT’D) 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
kids. 1
And 1
the 1
parents 1
and 1
the 1
teachers. 1
They’d 1
see 1
this 1
Black 1
girl 1
and 1
this 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
wonder 1
what 1
we 1
were 1
doing 1
together. 1
Even 1
at 1
nine 1
I 1
could 1
feel 1
their 1
eyes 1
on 1
me. 1
Especially 1
at 1
nine. 1
It 1
brought 1
tears 1
to 1
my 1
eyes. 1
Gabe’s 1
stone 1
face 1
melts 1
at 1
this. 1

SAM 1
(CONT’D) 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
bratty 1
girl, 1
didn’t 1
know 1
any 1
better 1
but-- 1
The 1
thought 1
of 1
losing 1
him-- 1
You 1
know? 1
I 1
just 1
feel 1
so 1
bad. 1
How 1
awful 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
to 1
him? 1
To 1
anyone 1
I 1
love? 1
Gabe 1
gets 1
it. 1
This 1
is 1
an 1
explanation. 1
An 1
apology, 1
to 1
him. 1
His 1
arm 1
is 1
on 1
her 1
shoulder 1
now. 1
GABE 1
I’m 1
sure 1
he 1
forgives 1
you. 1
Think 1
so? 1
SAM 1
Gabe 1
nods. 1
Sam’s 1
normal 1
defenses 1
come 1
back 1
up 1
lest 1
she 1
cries. 1
SAM 1
(CONT’D) 1
So 1
anyway. 1
I 1
didn’t 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
all 1
of 1
that. 1
I 1
don’t 1
know 1
why 1
I 1
did. 1
GABE 1
Sam. 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
going? 1
SAM 1
I 1
don’t 1
know. 1
Lunch? 1
Gabe 1
starts 1
to 1
walk 1
with 1
her. 1
GABE 1
Isn’t 1
it 1
Mac 1
and 1
Cheese 1
day 1
at 1
Armstrong/Parker? 1
SAM 1
Think 1
they’ll 1
let 1
you 1
in? 1
Gabe 1
smiles. 1
They 1
walk 1
a 1
bit. 1
Then 1
he 1
grabs 1
her 1
hand. 1
Sam 1
lets 1
the 1
moment 1
happen. 1
Squeezes 1
his 1
back. 1
They 1
look 1
into 1
each 1
others’ 1

Don’t 1
